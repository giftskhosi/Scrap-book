            <h3>My Two Cents</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this site is to act as a code bank account to recent graduates where they will save their projects which they would
                like to show to their potential employer. The tech industry is a broad industry which requires a person to be skilled in order
                 to stand a chance of being hireable. This industry is one of the most flexible industries where one can be an employer and an
                  employee at the same time. <strong>How?</strong> you might ask. well let me break it down for you: Me as a Software developer (Remote) I can
                   work for a web development company and also found my own Application development company. <strong> Won't this affect my employment
                    contract? </strong>well for the fact that i work for a company that develops website, it means that the app development space is still
                     vacent till someone fills it up, why can that someone be me? I mean i won't be stealing information from my employer to enrich 
                     myself, i would just be expending my wings in a totally different concept from the one i am hired from.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Another interesting thing about the tech industry is that its well diversed and filled with wonderful opportunities. For those who are 
                interested in entering the tech industry, its really simple but it requires time (more than just one or two hours a week but 10 to 12), 
                consistency and commitment. Even I as a Diploma in Information Technology graduate, i still have a lot to learn my journey is yet to begin.
